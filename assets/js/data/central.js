   assets/js/data/kerala.js for the schema reference and the general
   "why three primitives" rationale.

   RULE-ACCURACY NOTE (carried over from the original central.js build):
   researched against CCS (Leave) Rules 1972 and current DoPT circulars;
   deliberately differs from Kerala where the rules genuinely differ —
   Extraordinary Leave (Rule 32) has no named sub-purposes, Hospital Leave
   was replaced by WRIIL (2019), Child Care Leave has no Kerala equivalent,
   there is no central-govt "Probation Declaration" employee-filed form.
